Bukkit plugin - allows players to draw directly onto minecraft maps. 
Pixel tables will be loaded asynchronously first run - this may take some time.

### NOTE
Use a plugin manager to reload your server whenever you update ArtMap - the Spigot reload command will freak out and throw a bunch of exceptions.
